      <p>Hi,<br>my name is Hadif Mufti. I am currently a senior at the International School
        of Bellevue. As a tradition,
        all graduating seniors must complete a
        <a href=https://bsd405.org/international/about/senior-project/>Senior Project</a> based off the topic of their
          choice, with guidance from mentors and staff. For my project, I wanted to explore internet addiction as I have
          seen many peers struggle with balancing responsibilities like school work with video game and social media use
          in particular. </p> <p>I wanted to be realistic, there was no way I could cure internet addiction on my own with
          0 knowledge on addiction. So, I thought a better idea would be to create a website with information about
          internet addiction and a quiz to see if people exhibit symptoms of internet addiction, so they can get help.</p>
      <p>For my project, I needed to learn about addiction so I researched the psychology of it including watching
        podcasts, readings, and a tour at <a href="https://www.netaddictionrecovery.com/">reSTART</a>. With this
        knowledge, I then learned web development through online research including the basics of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. I created this website from scratch and without the use of third party programs that guide you through
        the process of making a website.</p>
      <p>Although, it must be stated that since I am NOT an addiction professional I cannot diagnose anyone. Although, the
        information in my website is all from profesionals and is cited. </p>
      <p>Thanks</p>
      <p>Contact me through <a href="mailto: hadifmufti2013@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
